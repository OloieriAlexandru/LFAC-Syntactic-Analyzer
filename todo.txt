1) Language:
* Predefined types: int , float, char, string, bool 									- done
* User defined data types;  provide specific syntax to allow initialization and use of variables of these types 	- done
* Array types 														- done
* Variable declarations/definition, constant definitions 								- done
* Control statements (if, for, while, etc.), assignment statements 							- done
* Arithmetic and boolean expressions											- done
* Operations with string types												- done
* Function calls which can have as parameters: expressions, other function calls, identifiers, constants 		- done
* A predefined function called Eval which has a parameter of typr int							- done
2) Symbol table:
- Information regarding variable or constant identifiers
	* type, value, scope												- done
- Information regarding function identifiers
	* the function signature											- done
	* whether the function is a method in a class									- done
3) Semantic analysis:
* Any variable that appears in a program has been previously defined							- done
* A variable should not be declared more than once									- done
* A variable appearing in the right side of an expression should have been initialized explicitly			- to do
* A function is not defined more than once with the same signature							- done
* A function that is called in the program has been defined								- done
* The left side of an assignment has the same type as the right side							- to do
* The parameters of a function call have the types from the function definition						- to do
* In any call to Eval, the parameter has type int									- done
4) Evaluation of arithmetic expressions in a program
* Evaluation logic													- done
* For each call of the form Eval(expr), the actual value of expr will be printed					- done
